## üöÄ How to Apply Rules

### Method 1: Firebase Console (Recommended - Easiest)

#### Step 1: Apply Firestore Rules
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/daxido-native/firestore/rules
2. Copy **entire content** from `firestore.rules` (384 lines)
3. Delete current content in Firebase Console
4. Paste and click **Publish**
5. ‚úÖ Done!

#### Step 2: Apply Realtime Database Rules
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/daxido-native/database/daxido-native-default-rtdb/rules
2. Copy **entire content** from `database.rules.json` (204 lines)
3. Delete current content in Firebase Console
4. Paste and click **Publish**
5. ‚úÖ Done!

#### Step 3: Apply Storage Rules
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/daxido-native/storage/daxido-native.firebasestorage.app/rules
2. Copy **entire content** from `storage.rules` (104 lines)
3. Delete current content in Firebase Console
4. Paste and click **Publish**
5. ‚úÖ Done!

### Method 2: Firebase CLI (One Command)

```bash
cd /Users/shakthi./Downloads/Daxido-native-android

# Login to Firebase (if not already logged in)
firebase login

# Deploy all rules at once
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,database,storage

# Verify deployment
firebase firestore:rules:get
firebase database:get /.settings/rules
```

## üß™ Testing Your Rules

### Test Authentication
```javascript
// User accessing their own profile - SHOULD ALLOW
firestore.collection("users").doc(auth.uid).get()

// User accessing another user's profile - SHOULD DENY
firestore.collection("users").doc("other_user_id").get()
```

### Test Ride Access
```javascript
// Participant accessing ride - SHOULD ALLOW
// where auth.uid == ride.userId OR auth.uid == ride.driverId
firestore.collection("rides").doc(rideId).get()

// Non-participant accessing ride - SHOULD DENY
firestore.collection("rides").doc(rideId).get()
```

### Test Real-time Database
```javascript
// Driver updating their own location - SHOULD ALLOW
database.ref(`driver_locations/${auth.uid}`).set({...})

// Driver updating another driver's location - SHOULD DENY
database.ref(`driver_locations/other_driver_id`).set({...})
```

### Test Storage
```javascript
// User uploading their profile image - SHOULD ALLOW
storage.ref(`users/${auth.uid}/profile/photo.jpg`).putFile(...)

// User uploading to another user's profile - SHOULD DENY
storage.ref(`users/other_user_id/profile/photo.jpg`).putFile(...)
```

## üîê Security Features

### ‚úÖ Authentication
- All operations require Firebase Authentication
- No anonymous access (except public FAQs)
- auth.uid validation throughout

### ‚úÖ Authorization
- **Ownership**: Users can only access their own data
- **Participation**: Only ride participants can view/modify rides
- **Role-based**: Drivers have special permissions for driver data

### ‚úÖ Data Validation
- **Firestore**: Field validation, required fields, data types
- **Realtime DB**: `.validate` rules for required children
- **Storage**: File type validation, size limits

### ‚úÖ Immutability
- Transactions cannot be modified (financial integrity)
- Chat messages cannot be edited (audit trail)
- Ratings are immutable after creation

### ‚úÖ Privacy
- Users cannot see other users' wallets
- Users cannot see other users' transactions
- Users cannot see other users' notifications
- Drivers cannot see other drivers' earnings

### ‚úÖ Performance
- Indexes defined for efficient queries
- `.indexOn` for frequently queried fields
- Optimized path matching

### ‚úÖ Default Deny
- All unlisted collections/paths explicitly denied
- Fail-secure by default
- No accidental data exposure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

### Before Production:
1. ‚úÖ Apply all three rule files
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Test with real user accounts
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor Firebase Console for denied requests
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable Firebase App Check (prevents abuse)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Set up billing alerts
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Configure backup for Firestore
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Review Firebase security best practices

### File Upload Limits:
- Profile images: 5MB (prevents abuse)
- Documents: 10MB (licenses, insurance, etc.)
- Chat media: 20MB (images, audio, video)
- All other: 5-10MB

### Monitoring:
- Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Usage
- Review denied requests in Firestore ‚Üí Usage ‚Üí Rules
- Set up Cloud Functions for security logging
- Enable Crashlytics for error tracking
