- ✅ Cash payments
- ✅ Wallet operations
- ✅ Ride allocation
- ✅ Driver response handling
- ✅ Ride status updates
- ✅ Emergency alerts

**Usage:**
```bash

```

### 3. Performance Testing (`performance-test.js`)

Comprehensive performance and load testing:

- **Load Testing**: 50 concurrent users for 1 minute
- **Stress Testing**: High-frequency operations
- **Response Time Analysis**: Min, max, average, percentiles
- **Error Rate Analysis**: Success/failure rates
- **Throughput Measurement**: Requests per second

**Usage:**
```bash
node performance-test.js
```

### 4. Deployment Verification (`verify-deployment.js`)

Verifies that all components are properly deployed:

- ✅ Firebase Functions deployment
- ✅ Firestore connectivity and rules
- ✅ Realtime Database access
- ✅ Cloud Storage rules
- ✅ Test data existence
- ✅ Payment configuration

**Usage:**
```bash
node verify-deployment.js
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Setup

1. **Firebase Configuration**: Ensure `app/google-services.json` exists
2. **Firebase Rules**: Deploy rules using `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,database,storage`
3. **Functions**: Deploy using `firebase deploy --only functions`

### Test Configuration

Modify test parameters in the respective script files:

```javascript
// test-data-setup.js
const TEST_CONFIG = {
  USERS_COUNT: 50,
  DRIVERS_COUNT: 20,
  RIDES_COUNT: 100,
  // ... other settings
};

// performance-test.js
const PERFORMANCE_CONFIG = {
  CONCURRENT_USERS: 50,
  REQUESTS_PER_USER: 10,
  TEST_DURATION_MS: 60000,
  // ... other settings
};
```

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Payment Flow Scenarios

1. **Wallet Payment - Sufficient Balance**
   - User has ₹5000 wallet balance
   - Ride fare: ₹150
   - Expected: Payment successful

2. **Wallet Payment - Insufficient Balance**
   - User has ₹100 wallet balance
   - Ride fare: ₹10000
   - Expected: Payment failed

3. **Razorpay Payment**
   - Amount: ₹200
   - Expected: Order created successfully

4. **Stripe Payment**
   - Amount: ₹300
   - Expected: PaymentIntent created

5. **Cash Payment**
   - Amount: ₹250
   - Expected: Transaction recorded as pending

### Performance Scenarios

1. **Load Testing**
   - 50 concurrent users
   - 1-minute duration
   - Mixed operations (read/write/function calls)

2. **Stress Testing**
   - High-frequency Firestore writes (100 operations)
   - Concurrent payment processing (50 operations)
   - Rapid ride allocation (30 operations)

3. **Response Time Analysis**
   - Measure min, max, average response times
   - Calculate 95th and 99th percentiles
   - Identify performance bottlenecks

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase Functions Not Deployed**
   ```bash
   cd functions
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

2. **Permission Denied Errors**
   ```bash
   # Check Firebase rules
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

3. **Test Data Not Found**
   ```bash
   # Run test data setup
   node test-data-setup.js
   ```

4. **Performance Test Failures**
   - Check Firebase quotas
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Review function timeout settings

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=true node payment-flow-test.js
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 1000ms average
- **Success Rate**: > 95%
- **Throughput**: > 50 requests/second
- **95th Percentile**: < 2000ms
- **99th Percentile**: < 5000ms

### Scaling Recommendations

- **High Load**: Implement caching strategies
- **Database**: Use Firestore composite indexes
- **Functions**: Consider Cloud Run for CPU-intensive tasks
- **Monitoring**: Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring
