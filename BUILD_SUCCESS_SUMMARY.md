## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Debug & Staging Builds
Currently, **only Release build works** because `google-services.json` only has `com.daxido` configured.

To enable Debug and Staging builds:
1. Add apps in Firebase Console:
   - `com.daxido.debug`
   - `com.daxido.staging`
2. Download updated `google-services.json`
3. Replace the current file

**See:** `ADD_DEBUG_APPS_TO_FIREBASE.md` for detailed instructions

### Current Build Configuration
```
✅ Release:  com.daxido           → WORKS
❌ Debug:    com.daxido.debug     → Needs Firebase app
❌ Staging:  com.daxido.staging   → Needs Firebase app
```

## 🔧 Firebase Services to Enable

### Already Configured in Firebase Console
- ✅ Authentication (Phone)
- ✅ Cloud Firestore
- ✅ Realtime Database
- ✅ Cloud Storage
- ✅ Cloud Messaging (FCM)

### Need to Apply Security Rules
Copy rules from `FIREBASE_SETUP_AND_FIXES.md` and apply in Firebase Console:

1. **Firestore Rules** → Firestore Database → Rules tab
2. **Realtime Database Rules** → Realtime Database → Rules tab
3. **Storage Rules** → Storage → Rules tab

Or use the setup script:
```bash
./setup-firebase.sh deploy
```

## 📱 Test with Real Device

### Prerequisites
1. Android device with API 24+ (Android 7.0+)
2. Enable USB debugging
3. Internet connection
4. Phone number for OTP testing

### Steps
```bash
# 1. Connect device via USB
adb devices

# 2. Install APK
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# 3. Launch app
adb shell am start -n com.daxido/.MainActivity

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: OTP Not Received
**Solutions:**
1. Check SHA-1 fingerprint is added to Firebase
2. Verify Phone Auth is enabled in Firebase Console
3. Use test phone numbers for development
4. Check internet connection

### Issue: Firestore Permission Denied
**Solution:** Apply security rules from documentation

### Issue: App Crashes on Launch
**Solutions:**
1. Check logcat: `adb logcat | grep AndroidRuntime`
2. Verify `google-services.json` is correct
3. Ensure all Firebase services are enabled

### Issue: Payment Not Working
**Note:** Payment gateway integration (Razorpay/Stripe) needs additional configuration. Currently records transactions in Firebase.
