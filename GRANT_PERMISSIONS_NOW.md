## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you don't see "Add member" button:
- You might not have Owner/Editor permissions
- Ask project owner (nayaz@daxido.com) to grant you permissions

### If roles don't appear in dropdown:
- Make sure you're searching in the right project (daxido-native)
- Try typing the full role name: `roles/cloudfunctions.admin`

### If deployment still fails after 2 minutes:
- Check that all 3 roles were added
- Wait another minute and retry
- Check Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=781620504101
