2. `drivers` - Driver profiles & documents
3. `rides` - Ride requests & history
4. `wallets` - User wallets
5. `transactions` - Payment transactions

---

## üîê Security Principles

### 1. **Authentication Required**
- All operations require Firebase Authentication
- No anonymous access allowed

### 2. **Ownership Validation**
- Users can only access their own data
- Drivers can only modify their own profiles

### 3. **Ride Participation**
- Only the user and assigned driver can view/modify rides
- No cross-user data leakage

### 4. **Immutable Records**
- Transactions cannot be modified (ledger integrity)
- Chat messages cannot be edited or deleted
- Ratings cannot be changed after submission

### 5. **Cloud Function Reserved**
- Payments, earnings, and analytics are write-protected
- Only cloud functions can modify these collections

### 6. **Default Deny**
- Any unlisted collection is explicitly denied
- Fail-secure by default

---

## üìñ Rules Breakdown

### 1. Users Collection (`/users/{userId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: Anyone authenticated (for driver-user interaction)
‚úÖ Create: Only owner can create their profile
‚úÖ Update: Only owner can update their profile
‚úÖ Delete: Only owner can delete their profile

Subcollections:
  - /paymentMethods/{methodId}  ‚Üí Owner read/write
  - /favoriteDrivers/{favoriteId} ‚Üí Owner read/write
  - /emergencyContacts/{contactId} ‚Üí Owner read/write
```

**Why?**
- Drivers need to see user names during rides
- Users maintain full control of their data
- Payment methods are private to the user

---

### 2. Drivers Collection (`/drivers/{driverId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: Anyone authenticated (for driver matching)
‚úÖ Create: Only the driver themselves
‚úÖ Update: Only the driver themselves
‚úÖ Delete: Only the driver themselves

Subcollections:
  - /documents/{documentId}  ‚Üí Driver only
  - /earnings/{earningId}    ‚Üí Read-only (Cloud Functions write)
  - /ratings/{ratingId}      ‚Üí Immutable after creation
```

**Why?**
- Users need to see driver profiles when booking
- Drivers manage their own documents
- Earnings are calculated by backend (tamper-proof)

---

### 3. Rides Collection (`/rides/{rideId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: User OR Driver involved in the ride
‚úÖ Create: User only (must be SEARCHING status)
‚úÖ Update: User OR Driver involved
‚ùå Delete: No one (audit trail)
```

**Why?**
- Privacy: Only ride participants see ride details
- Audit: Rides cannot be deleted (legal/compliance)
- Status validation prevents manipulation

---

### 4. Wallets Collection (`/wallets/{userId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: Owner only
‚úÖ Create: Owner only (balance ‚â• 0)
‚úÖ Update: Owner only (balance must stay ‚â• 0)
‚ùå Delete: No deletion allowed
```

**Why?**
- Wallets are sensitive financial data
- Negative balance prevention
- Wallet history preserved

---

### 5. Transactions Collection (`/transactions/{transactionId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: Owner only
‚úÖ Create: User can create their transaction
‚ùå Update: No updates (immutable ledger)
‚ùå Delete: No deletions (audit trail)
```

**Why?**
- Financial audit trail
- Compliance with payment regulations
- Prevents transaction tampering

---

### 6. Notifications Collection (`/notifications/{notificationId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: Owner only
‚úÖ Create: Anyone (usually cloud functions)
‚úÖ Update: Owner (only 'isRead' field)
‚úÖ Delete: Owner can delete their notifications
```

**Why?**
- Users control their notification feed
- Backend can send notifications
- Only mark-as-read updates allowed

---

### 7. Active Pools Collection (`/active_pools/{poolId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: Anyone authenticated (for matching)
‚úÖ Create: Authenticated users
‚úÖ Update: Capacity validation (currentOccupancy ‚â§ maxCapacity)
‚ùå Delete: Cloud functions only
```

**Why?**
- Public pools for ride matching
- Capacity limits enforced
- Backend manages pool cleanup

---

### 8. Promo Codes

```javascript
/promoCodes/{promoCode}
  ‚úÖ Read: Anyone authenticated
  ‚ùå Write: Admin/Cloud Functions only

/userPromoUsage/{usageId}
  ‚úÖ Read: Owner only
  ‚úÖ Create: User can record usage
  ‚ùå Update/Delete: Immutable
```

**Why?**
- Users can view available promos
- Usage tracking prevents fraud
- Admin-managed promo creation

---

### 9. Live Chat Collection (`/chats/{chatRoomId}`)

```javascript
Chat Rooms:
  ‚úÖ Read/Create/Update: User OR Driver in the chat

/messages/{messageId} subcollection:
  ‚úÖ Read: Participants
  ‚úÖ Create: Sender only
  ‚ùå Update/Delete: Immutable messages
```

**Why?**
- Private conversations
- Message history preserved
- Audit trail for disputes

---

### 10. Support & FAQs

```javascript
/faqs/{faqId}
  ‚úÖ Read: Anyone
  ‚ùå Write: Admin only

/support_tickets/{ticketId}
  ‚úÖ Read: Owner only
  ‚úÖ Create/Update: Owner only
  ‚ùå Delete: No deletion

/livechats/{chatId}
  ‚úÖ Read/Write: Owner only
```

**Why?**
- Public FAQ access
- Private support tickets
- Customer service tracking

---

### 11. Configuration (`/config/{configId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: Anyone authenticated
‚ùå Write: Admin/Cloud Functions only
```

**Why?**
- App settings available to all users
- Admin-controlled configuration

---

### 12. Favorite Drivers (`/favoriteDrivers/{favoriteId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: Owner only
‚úÖ Create/Update/Delete: Owner only
```

**Why?**
- Private user preferences
- User-managed favorites

---

### 13. Vehicle Maintenance (`/vehicleMaintenance/{maintenanceId}`)

```javascript
‚úÖ Read: Driver only
‚úÖ Create/Update/Delete: Driver only
```

**Why?**
- Private driver records
- Maintenance tracking

---

### 14. FCM Queue, Analytics & Metrics

```javascript
/fcm_queue/{queueId}
  ‚ùå Read/Write: Denied (Cloud Functions only)

/analytics/{docId}, /metrics/{docId}
  ‚úÖ Read: Authenticated
  ‚ùå Write: Cloud Functions only
```

**Why?**
- Backend-managed queues
- Protected analytics data

---

### 15. Default Deny Rule

```javascript
match /{document=**} {
  ‚ùå allow read, write: if false;
}
```

**Critical!**
- Any collection not explicitly defined is DENIED
- Fail-secure by default
- Prevents accidental data exposure

---

## üöÄ How to Apply These Rules

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Recommended)

1. Go to [Firestore Rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/daxido-native/firestore/rules)

2. **Delete everything** in the editor

3. Open `firestore.rules` file in your project

4. **Copy ALL 384 lines** from the file

5. **Paste** into Firebase Console

6. Click **Publish**

7. ‚úÖ Done! Rules are live immediately

### Option 2: Firebase CLI

```bash
cd /Users/shakthi./Downloads/Daxido-native-android

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Verify deployment
firebase firestore:rules:get
```

---

## üß™ Testing the Rules

### Test Cases

#### ‚úÖ Should Allow

```javascript
// User reading their own profile
get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(auth.uid))

// User creating a ride
create(/databases/$(database)/documents/rides/ride123) {
  data: { userId: auth.uid, status: 'SEARCHING' }
}

// Driver updating ride status
update(/databases/$(database)/documents/rides/ride123) {
  // where driver.uid == ride.driverId
}

// User marking notification as read
update(/databases/$(database)/documents/notifications/notif123) {
  data: { isRead: true }
}
```

#### ‚ùå Should Deny

```javascript
// User reading another user's wallet
get(/databases/$(database)/documents/wallets/otherUserId)

// Modifying a transaction
update(/databases/$(database)/documents/transactions/txn123)

// Deleting a ride
delete(/databases/$(database)/documents/rides/ride123)

// User reading another user's notifications
get(/databases/$(database)/documents/notifications/other_notif)

// Accessing unlisted collection
get(/databases/$(database)/documents/secret_data/doc123)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. **Production Checklist**

Before going live:
- [ ] Apply these rules to Firestore
- [ ] Test with real user accounts
- [ ] Verify driver access works
- [ ] Test ride creation/updates
- [ ] Confirm wallet operations
- [ ] Validate notification permissions
- [ ] Test promo code application

### 2. **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue**: "Missing or insufficient permissions"
- **Check**: User is authenticated
- **Check**: User is trying to access their own data
- **Check**: Rules are published in Firebase Console

**Issue**: "PERMISSION_DENIED"
- **Cause**: Resource.data doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Use `request.resource.data` for creates/updates

**Issue**: Wallet updates failing
- **Cause**: Balance validation
- **Solution**: Ensure `balance >= 0`

### 3. **Security Best Practices**

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Keep authentication required for all operations
- Validate data types and constraints
- Use immutable records for audit trails
- Test rules thoroughly before production
- Monitor security logs regularly

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Remove authentication checks
- Allow `allow read, write: if true`
- Expose sensitive fields in rules
- Skip validation on updates
- Ignore security warnings
